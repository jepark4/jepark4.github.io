# Building MY Github Blog for 2021 
## This is my own GitHub blog starting from 2021 

Hello! Welcome to my github blog web source. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am using Jekyll as you can see from my blog. Most of the time it would be random posts related to my interests. 
It is my first time using (well not first time) but i'm still a newbie in markdown. 

My prior interest lies in Finance, Investment, stock investment, analysis, energy, coding and construction management. 
I know it's a lot but i will try to update from time to time 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## There are some of the things that i want to do 
1. Upload summary of finance courses 
2. Come up with some macro economic material everyday 
3. Try to develop better sense of blog!
